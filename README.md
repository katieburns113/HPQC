# HPQC Portfolio

Repository contains tasks solved and attempted by me.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Task 1: Introduction to the course

- Check access to Frank and Cheetah`
- Used the commands `mpicc` and `mpiexec`
- Set up my GitHub repository

---

## Task 2: Performance and Parallelism

Part 1: Introducing the time command
- Ran the time ls command and got the expected output
Part 2: Benchmarking with time
- Measured the runtime of two 'hello world' programmes. The c program runtime was instant and the python program runtime was 
  delayed by a few seconds
- Also measured the runtime of two 'repeat adder' programmes. It was the same that c was faster than python. 
Part 3: Benchmarking Internally
- Got the runtime value by subtracting the start and end times.
- Ouput time was longer for both but python code had the higher runtime
Part 4: Modify the code
- The 'repeat adder' program was modified to loop 10 million times nad this took longer to run
- Python was still slower than c in the loop.
